# Students' marks and Ranking Management System

Python-based program designed to manage student marks and rank them based on their performance. It allows users to add, update, and delete student records through a menu-driven interface, and automatically displays rankings by sorting the students according to their marks. The system uses Python dictionaries to store data efficiently and provides a clear, console-based output to make the results easy to understand.
